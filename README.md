# beranek1 analytics
A ready to use collection of php scripts for web analytics.

beranek1 analytics is a yet unfinished project based on php scripts I made in my past for analysing web traffic, feel free to leave feedback and use them for your own projects. Currently I have no concrete plans on finishing or continuing the project, but I'll use the time I have to fix bugs and keep it working.

analyser.php and statistics.php are just experimental yet, but shall work.

Before using the scripts you need to modify the mysql parameters (host, user, password, database) in database.php else none of the scripts will work.

Use example.php as sample code for integrating analytics.php into your own scripts.
($b1_analytics->echoscript() is not necessary and might breaks the design of your website if used.)

Always remember to inform your users of data collection in your privacy policy!
